 *
 * Objective
 * In this challenge, we learn about geometric distributions. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!
 *
 * Task
 * The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1/3.
 * What is the probability that the 1st defect is found during the 5th inspection?
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator and denominator for the probability of a defect,
 * and the second line contains the inspection we want the probability of being the first defect for:
 * 1 3
 * 5
 * If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.
 *
 * Output Format
 * Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).
